We developed this world-discovering game using the Python library Pygame.

Title: CREATION OF THE VIDEO GAME "OutLands"  

 
KEYWORDS: video game, 2D exploration style, python/pygames

CONTEXT:  
Video games are very popular, especially among young people. Apart from being a pastime, they represent a real challenge in terms of programming and graphics: in this sense, it has turned out to be a project that is both fun to set up and in which we can learn to manipulate codes, new libraries, and use platforms that will help us in our computer engineering training. It will also be a way to express our creativity through the designs of characters and places and through different gameplay phases. And it is especially a challenge for us as it will require collaboration on the code that we often write alone and also personal effort especially to create a game with a unique visual identity and interesting gameplay and not just a personality-less copy of a Zelda. The goal is to produce a playful game for the general public.

SUBJECT:  
The project consists of creating an exploration game like Zelda or Pok√©mon using the pygame library. The main character will have a health bar and the goal of the game is to defeat the final boss: by reducing their health bar to 0 while maintaining their own. In the course of this adventure, the character will face opponents who can be stunned (reduce their health bar to 0) using tools (weapons or special attacks). Defeating an opponent will increase the character's experience level depending on the difficulty of the opponents. An opponent's difficulty will depend on their health bar and movements. The player loses if their health points reach 0, in which case the game restarts from the last save point (checkpoint). A game starts from the checkpoint and ends with a confrontation with the boss of the area.  
What will characterize our game is the presence of special gems: these are magical stones that contain special powers that the character can use in their quest, they can unlock them as the game progresses. The power of a gem can be used if the player obtains a specific number of points by annihilating more enemies. Among the gems there is: the gem of destruction, it allows to create a zone in the terrain, more precisely a circle where every enemy within it will be annihilated in one hit, if the enemy is actually a level boss, it will not be annihilated but it will take much more damage than a normal attack; the "second chance" gem, it allows the character to revive in case their health points reach 0. It should be noted that only one gem can be used at a time, this means that once a gem is used, the number of points to unlock it falls back to 0, and therefore if the player wants to use the same or another gem they will have to collect points again.

EXPECTED RESULTS:  
[specify the deliverables (demonstrator, experience, simulation, software, prototype, user manual, etc.).  
Final deliverable: complete version of the game  
Intermediate deliverables:  
Game sprites (png format)  
A game tutorial (this will be a python code that contains a simple part of the game to teach players the basic movements)  
A PowerPoint each month highlighting the progress in the game's development. (Player movements, implementation of opponents, implementation of items or special abilities, etc.)  
An explanatory video (.mp4)  
A game demo. (this will be a python code that contains a basic functional level of the game demonstrating the basic mechanics of the game such as movements, collisions with walls, damage... unlike the game tutorial, this is a more advanced version of the game programming that will contain opponents, the character will be able to perform special attacks, collect gems, etc.)

TOOLS USED:  
We chose the Python programming language because we are familiar with it. The tools we will use are as follows:  
IDE: PyCharm  
Python libraries:  
Pygames version 2.0: Python library suitable for creating simple 2D video games especially for pixel art games.[1] [2]  
Pytmx: read .tmx type files.  
The Tiled software to create the maps of the different game levels of tmx type. [2]  
Collaborative work: GitHub [3]

THE STORY:

The story revolves around a young boy whose sister is kidnapped by an emperor who wants to marry her. Thus, the character travels through different worlds, facing several enemies and collecting numerous gems that make him more powerful, to finally arrive at the wedding venue to save his sister.

Detailed Scenario:

World 1: (the woods)

The character went to a village where he trained for his great journey, after his training he faced enemies (fire-headed dragon, and small monsters). At the end of this world, he confronts a space samurai. Once defeated, he gains a gem and moves on to the next world. Game Initiation: the player learns to manipulate the character by facing the first enemies. (see appendix)

World 2: (the ice field)

Discovery of an ice field map: fir trees, tundra drawing, sea drawing, and ice floes. He explored two levels: Tundra species, you can go everywhere, ice floe with the sea. The character encountered a polar bear, a snowman that attacks by throwing carrots. There was also a hunter who could attack from a very long distance. The player also won two gems in this world. (see appendix)

World 3: (desert)

The character first arrives in a desert, where he must face living skeletons, to finally reach a giant earthworm. Once defeated, he gains a gem and continues his journey until he arrives at a mummy, once it's beaten he gains a gem and moves to the next world. (see appendix)

World 4: (the fairy garden and the wedding venue):

The character arrives in a garden, he first meets a fairy in distress attacked by a ghost. Knowing she was lost, he helped her find her way by fighting more ghosts until they reached the fairy tree where he is taken hostage. But the fairy he helped is the queen's daughter, who tested him by making him fight a dark bat. Once the bat is defeated, she asks for his help to fight the monsters in the garden. Apparently, there was a large castle in the garden under which resided a crystal containing a gem in complete stability, but the emperor arrived and raised the castle to the sky, leaving the crystal exposed, which made it unstable and thus generated monsters. The queen gives him a gem to help him, then the hero crosses the garden fighting various monsters, all while following the river. He arrives at the unstable crystal and fights the last generated monster. Having done this, he took the gem from the crystal, which sent him to the castle in the sky to bring it back to earth. The character ascended the castle, confronting formidable opponents on each floor. On the last floor, the wedding took place, which he interrupted, and fought in the clouds against the emperor's knight (final battle of the story). (see appendix)

Denouement:

After defeating the last monster, the sister is gravely injured. The character cried, but with the help of the ninth gem possessed by the last monster. A wish is granted to the boy, who wishes for his sister to be saved. He finally succeeds in saving her and they return home and live happily ever after.
